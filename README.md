# **Welcome to Coup!**

**About**

Coup is a fast-paced and strategic tabletop card game set in a dystopian universe where players engage in political intrigue, deception, and manipulation to eliminate their opponents and rise to power. Designed for 2 to 6 players, Coup combines elements of bluffing, deduction, and social interaction, making it a thrilling and unpredictable experience. The game is played with a deck of character cards representing different roles within the government.

**Gameplay**

Each player is dealt two character cards face down, which they keep hidden from their opponents. These characters grant special abilities that players can use to influence the game and eliminate other players' characters [The Assassin, The Contessa, The Duke, The Ambassador, *NEW CARD, *NEW CARD]. On their turn, players can take various actions, including using the abilities of their characters, claiming to have a specific character with corresponding abilities (even if they don't), or initiating a coup against another player to force them to lose one of their characters. However, players are not required to tell the truth about the characters they possess, leading to a constant atmosphere of suspicion and distrust. A key element of Coup is bluffing. Players can claim to have any character card they wish, even if it contradicts the cards they actually hold. If challenged by another player, the accused must reveal one of their character cards. If their claim was false, they lose that character; if true, the challenger loses one of theirs. The game continues until only one player remains with at least one character card, declaring them the winner. With its simple rules, quick gameplay, and high replay value, Coup is a favorite among tabletop gamers who enjoy intense social interaction and strategic deception.
